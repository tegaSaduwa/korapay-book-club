# Instructions on running app

To run this app, you can download a vscode extension called 'live server' and launch or just simply run it by double-clicking on the index.html


# Assumptions

cards are placeholders
search suggests based on data provided

the app is using mock data I generated which can be found in the data folder using data.js file

e.g. type in the word 'built' on search bar to see sample output.


# Requirements

Every functionality works (search, mobile view etc) except for the overlay on each card which i noticed last minute, given a bit more time I would have finshed.
